COMMENTS:

This is the first script in the sequence necessary to produce
the results in "What Makes a Satisfying Life? Prediction and 
Interpretation with Machine-Learning Algorithms", 
Gentile et al. (2022).

Here, in particular, we proceed with adding the variables
reported in the British Cohort Study (BCS, henceforth) documentation 
as "Some Key Variables", and we add them - including necessary cleaning - 
to the original ones, used to produce the results in “What Predicts a
Successful Life? A Life-Course Model of Well-Being”, 
Layard et al. (2014).

These codes will be particularly rich in comments, to ensure 
readability also to less experienced Python coders.

If you have more experience, you can skip the parts explaining
the codes.

#A) Left joining ohe_followup_skv_indvars with the physical health at 26
#from Clark and Lepinteur (2019).

#B) Left join the resulting dataset from A) with mental health at 26
#from Layard et al. (2014).

#C) Inner joining the resulting dataset from B) with all the remaining
#Original variables from Layard et al. (2014).

#The first two joining operations were "left" instead of "inner"
#to avoid losing too many individuals. This means that 
#we accept reasonable degrees of missingness in physical and
#mental health in order to retain information about the
#other variables. 

#Anyway, the inner join at the third step guarantees a final dataset
#with 665 missings only in mental health, as reported in Section 2 of the paper.

#individual suffers as in Clark and Lepinteur (2019), 
#“The Causes and Consequences of Early-adult Unemployment:
