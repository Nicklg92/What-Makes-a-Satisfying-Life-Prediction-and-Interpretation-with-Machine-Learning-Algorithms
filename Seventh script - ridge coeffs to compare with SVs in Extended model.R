#COMMENTS:

#This is the seventh script in the sequence necessary to produce
#the results in "What Makes a Satisfying Life? Prediction and 
#Interpretation with Machine-Learning Algorithms", 
#Gentile et al. (2022). 

#In particular, this is the second of those necessary
#to produce the regression coefficients to be compared
#with the Shapley Values.

#For the Original model, we used the coefficients
#from the non-penalized linear regression, whereas for
#the Extended model, as specified in the paper, we
#use the coefficients from a (penalized) ridge
#regression.

#The reason for this is that if we were to consider 
#the coefficients from the non-penalized model,
#we would not have a coefficients for all the dropped
#dummies, which would therefore deflate the value
#of the derived coefficient (equations 15 and 16) in 
#the paper.
