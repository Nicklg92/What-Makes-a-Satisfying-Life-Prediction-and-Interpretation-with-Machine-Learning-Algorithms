# What-Makes-a-Satisfying-Life-Prediction-and-Interpretation-with-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

In the repository, there are all the scripts that I have written to get the results in the paper "What Makes a Satisfying Life? Prediction and Interpretation with Machine Learning Algorithms",
the first chapter of my doctoral thesis.

The paper was then written in collaboration with Andrew Clark, Conchita D'Ambrosio and Alexandre Tkatchenko.

All the scripts are rich in comments, which you can gloss over if you already have expertise in programming with R and Python. The reason for this choice is 
that people working in wellbeing often come from disciplines in which the mainstreams are STATA, SPSS or SAS. Hence, I hope in this manner the results are easier 
to then reproduce.

All the scripts have, in their name, the order in which they need to be run.

In order to obtain the results, it is necessary to have access to the British Cohort Study data.
